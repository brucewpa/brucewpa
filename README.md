#####
Company: Ita√∫ Unibanco

Position: CyberSecurity Engineer

Description:
As a member of the security projects team, my responsibilities include:

- Designing architectures that facilitate the implementation, maintenance, and phased retirement of resources dedicated to asset protection and management.
- Identifying security vulnerabilities and mitigating associated risks.
- Conducting supplier evaluations through proofs of concept, benchmarks, and the creation and validation of requirements. 
- Developing, implementing, migrating, supporting, maintaining, and customizing tools focused on asset protection and visibility.
- Producing comprehensive documentation for each project, along with delivering presentations to senior management. 
- Ensuring adherence to regulations and compliance with standards such as CMN No. 4,893 (Central Bank), ISO 27001, LGPD, PNSI (Decree 9,637/2018), NIST SP 800-53, GDPR, and others.

Projects/activities:
- Development of a data lake for information security on the AWS cloud, featuring decentralized cost management and a scalable environment utilizing SNS and SQS queues. Key monitored assets included: Firewall, EC2 (Linux and Windows), CloudFront, S3, EKS, and ECS.  
- Creation and maintenance of StackSet infrastructures for the decentralized collection and transmission of logs across all bank accounts, exceeding 30,000 in total.
- Consumption of data from the Trend CAS API using Python and AWS Lambda, normalization of this data to Parquet format, and storage in an S3 bucket. For this task, API keys were securely stored in AWS Vault (KMS) and accessed through parameters.
- Automated backup of data from the SIEM in a cloud environment was performed using Python, with digital certificate authentication. The data was converted to a platform-agnostic format (JSON) and stored in S3 Glacier.
- A proof of concept for switching the SIEM/EDR/XDR solution was conducted, which involved practical testing of the four largest market players: Microsoft, Google, Splunk, and Palo Alto.
- Concept proof for the implementation of an ITDR solution aimed at sanitizing user data.
- Concept proof for the replacement of the IPS solution.
- Concept proof for the replacement of the Layer 7 Firewall within the bank's area.
- Development of a solution for malware analysis in files sent via WhatsApp and file-sharing channels, utilizing AWS, Go, Terraform, and GuardDuty.
- Conducted updates and ongoing maintenance for an infrastructure comprising 90 servers that support our Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution, which is distributed between on-premises and trade operations.
- Developed dashboards and alerts to enhance visibility of metrics and logs across DataDog, Splunk, CloudWatch, and AWS Athena. This includes monitoring actions taken by firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Privileged Access Management (PAM), and others.
- Configured and maintained the Palo Alto firewall, as well as the IPS and Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) from McAfee, Trend Micro‚Äôs Cloud App Security, and CrowdStrike EDR.
- Retired the legacy SIEM system, focusing on isolating it to mitigate the risks associated with maintaining legacy components required by the General Data Protection Law (LGPD).
- Migration of SOAR from on-premises to the cloud, alongside the upgrade of Python playbooks from version 3.8 to 3.12.
- Automation of firewall configuration extraction for Palo Alto, normalizing the data into a SQL table format, and uploading it to S3 for monitoring the completeness of the configuration.
- Optimization of cloud environments aimed at cost reduction.
- Assessment of resources utilizing DevOps pipelines with GitHub and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) through Terraform, including components such as Load Balancers, EC2 instances, S3 storage, CloudFront, EKS, ECS, and more.
- Engagement in data engineering activities, focusing on the planning and implementation of ELT-related structures using Python with Apache Spark.
- Integration of authentication for REST APIs through the AWS API Gateway, employing OpenID and OAuth with foundational protocols.
